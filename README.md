### **The Problem**

Most AI projects fail not because of the technology, but because of the gap between a C-suite goal and the on-the-ground reality of the teams, data, and systems expected to deliver it. Technology leaders need a way to quickly diagnose hidden risks before they become multi-million-dollar failures.

### **The Solution**

This application is a free, interactive diagnostic tool for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and other technology leaders. It's designed to provide an immediate, data-driven snapshot of an organization's readiness to adopt enterprise AI.

The purpose of this tool is to:

- **Provide Immediate Clarity:** Offer tangible, personalized feedback on an organization's strengths and critical gaps.
- **De-Risk Decision Making:** Help leaders identify unseen risks in their data, strategy, and team readiness.
- **Serve as a Bridge to Strategy:** Act as the starting point for a deeper, strategic conversation about turning AI ambition into an executable, low-risk reality.

### **Key Features for Leaders**

- **Strategic Self-Assessment:** A curated questionnaire that evaluates the core pillars of enterprise AI readiness.
- **Instantaneous, Shareable Reports:** Receive a detailed report with a readiness score, a strategic tier, and color-coded insights that can be shared with team members.
- **Data-Driven Conversation Starter:** The results page generates a unique URL, enabling a highly focused follow-up discussion based on concrete data.

### **Technology**

This is a modern, reliable, and secure client-side application built with **React** and **Bootstrap 5**, deployed via GitHub Actions.
