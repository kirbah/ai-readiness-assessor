    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up Node.js, and crucially, caches your npm dependencies for faster installs
      - name: Set up Node.js with caching
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"

      # 3. Installs dependencies using 'npm ci' which is faster and safer for CI
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. Runs the Prettier formatting check. This will fail if any code is not formatted.
      - name: Check code formatting
        run: npm run format:check

      # 5. Runs the build command. This will fail if the app doesn't compile.
